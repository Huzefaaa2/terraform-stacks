# terraform-stacks

A collection of production-ready Terraform Stacks that showcase enterprise patterns. Each Stack is self-contained with documentation, diagrams, and well-commented code.

## Projects

- [Application Stack (Project 1)](stacks/application-stack/README.md) – Deploy a full web application (networking, storage, compute, observability) as a single Stack with multi-deployment fan-out.
- [Multi-Region Stack (Project 2)](stacks/multi-region-stack/README.md) – Stamp the same service across regions and accounts without duplicating Terraform code.
- [Kubernetes Stack (Project 3)](stacks/kubernetes-stack/README.md) – Provision an EKS cluster, managed node groups, and platform add-ons from one Stack.
